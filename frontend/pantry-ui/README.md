## Pantry Frontend Overview
The Pantry application uses the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework to create a beautiful [SPA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) with custom CSS styles. The application is created with the [mobile first](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mobile_First) rule as a high priority, along with being easy, intuitive, and simple to use. While most JavaScript is embedded in Vue files, some exist in their own respective files; either way, we most use [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_es6.asp) features heavily.

## Development Setup
- Refer to the [Vue installation template](./Vue-setup-info.md) for installing the project in a new development environment
- All development is done through [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as extensions exist for all languages and it's multi-platform

## Contributing
1. Refer to [Git workflow notes](../../README.md#contributing) on setting up a feature branch and creating a pull request (you cannot push to **main** branch directly)
2. Please make you feature work ***first*** on mobile screens (I usually choose the iOS screen sizes on the Firefox web dev tools) before optimizing to desktop. *After then* should you create a pull request to finish that feature out
3. Please keep a consistent style with the rest of the system. (TODO a style guide will be created to refer to later on)

Thank you again for your contribution! As state a few times - and many more to come - this is a school project based on an Instagram post that I thought was cool, and could have a few more killer features to it. While it's hard to convince people this isn't another inventory application, future features will set this aside and might even change some peoples' lives on what they cook and how they meal prep. I know I can't single-handedly do it all, and that's why I made it open source!
