# Pantry

## What is this?
The Pantry application is a way to keep an inventory of all the food items you have, while also give you the power to check out nutritional values from the same place. The process of adding, removing, and/or modifying items involves using your phone's camera, scanning the item's barcode, and confirming you have the correct item. No painfully tedious interaction involved.

## Who is this for?
This is a per-home system designed to run on low powered devices such a Raspberry Pi and its equivalence. For the ones who like to keep track of what they have and what they're low on, this will be a nice addition.

## Who can have it?
**EVERYONE!!!** This uses the [MIT license](./LICENSE), so anyone and everyone can use it. Want a feature? [Go ahead!](#contributing) It's open source!

Also, a **big thank you** to any and all who contribute! This was an idea I had from an inspirational Instagram post that I turned into a school project, and any useful features and/or bug fixes is greatly appreciated
